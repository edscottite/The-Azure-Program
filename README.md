# **The Azure Program**
Designed and developed by Patrick Neil using C++.


 - Windows and MacOS supported ( Linux support is in development )

# Why should I use Azure?

The Azure Program is a piece of software that can run on any current operating system. It provides cyber-security capabilities such as as Network Montering (Who, When, and How Someone Connects to Your WAN - Wireless Area Network) and backdoor defensive capability (APPROVED APPS ONLY). The basic idea behind the project was the concept of accessibility. Did your mouse break? Type any keyboard shortcut to reach where you want to go. Want to challenge your intellect while having fun? Tetris and Pac-Man. The programme is designed as a small terminal to keep things clean and uncomplicated. The program's purpose is not to limit your device's capabilities, thus we utilise a minimalist design that can be customised by the user.
