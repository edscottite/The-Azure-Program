> Worked on UI Framework and Design, command integration (File Opening, Network Response), introduced the Administration settings, and started capturing Local Device Information. However, I struggled with integrating a command output for the graph displaying traffic, as I was tired at the time and my brain was starting to ache, plus I was getting frustrated with the issues encountered beforehand.

> Created the document and repository, with no code edits.

> Designed the foundation of the Engine architecture and began considering how to represent the traffic data model (I'm not set on the idea, as I'm unsure about its stability; too many queries may cause network disruption).

> Established the structure and operational features of the graph display, depicting traffic through an average refresh rate (measured in milliseconds) to create a real-time display effect. However, integration with the engine remains pending.

> Currently evaluating stability and security. While it's stable, the system is sending a query to the local network every 500 milliseconds, which the IT personnel at school could easily detect and consider a security threat. I'm brainstorming ideas to minimize this, such as randomizing the queries by 0-500 milliseconds to make the requests appear as "performance issues."

> Due to my uncertainty about how they're monitoring the network, I need to be precise in my approach. Running the program for over a minute would raise suspicion (perhaps even 30 seconds would be suspicious). Moreover, they have full control over each device and could easily identify which device is causing the disruption as the traffic would essentially be scrambled for that device.

> Upon further consideration, they can monitor who logs into which Chromebook and what they access.

> Designed the logo and integrated it into the Docks.

> Integrated Windows and MacOS, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions (including Big Sur).

> The security concern shouldn't be an issue on the administrative devices (I hope). Still unsure about the UI and name; the name has changed from "Remenue" to "Scift" and now to "Azure."

> Most functions and commands are complete, but making files executable on both MacOS and Windows is pending.

> Encountered various issues related to the Java pathway on my Mac, awaiting resolution.
